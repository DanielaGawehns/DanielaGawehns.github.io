Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD researcher at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/daniela-gawehns#tab-1) in the Netherlands. My work focuses on the integration of diverse data sources for pattern mining purposes. The main field of application are Nursing and Health Sciences, with side projects in Developmental Sciences and Urban Computing.

Before my PhD studies, I received a Masters degree in Clinical Neuropsychology and a Masters degree in Statistical Sciences. I am interested in building [bridges](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2019/06/interview-data-science-phd-daniela-gawehns) between different fields of research and translating challenges back-and-forth between experts. 

My aim as a researcher in computer science is to make reproducible research practices for machine learning research more common and to promote computer science as an open, diverse and welcoming field of research.
